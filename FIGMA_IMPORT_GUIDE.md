# Figma Import Guide - UI Specification

## 📋 Figma Import Dialog Options

When importing the PDF into Figma/FigJam, you'll see options:
- **Jamboard** - Google's whiteboard tool
- **Lucid** - Lucidchart/Lucidspark
- **Miro** - Online whiteboard platform
- **Mural** - Digital workspace tool
- **Other** - Generic PDF import

## ✅ Recommended Approach

### **Option 1: Select "Other" (Simplest)**

1. **In Figma dialog, select "Other"**
2. Click "Confirm"
3. Figma will import the PDF as a generic document
4. You can then:
   - Organize content in FigJam
   - Create frames for each section
   - Add design elements based on specification

**Pros:**
- Quick and simple
- No additional tools needed
- Content will be imported

**Cons:**
- May need manual formatting
- Layout might not be perfect

### **Option 2: Share Markdown/HTML Directly (Best for Collaboration)**

Instead of importing PDF, share the specification directly:

1. **Upload to Figma Team:**
   - Upload `FIGMA_UI_SPECIFICATION.md` or `.html` to Figma team files
   - Designer can read it directly
   - No import needed

2. **Or use MCP to share:**
   - Once MCP server is enabled
   - Can share files directly from Cursor to Figma

**Pros:**
- No import issues
- Designer can reference while designing
- Easy to update and share

**Cons:**
- Not visual/structured in Figma
- Designer needs to create designs manually

---

### **Option 3: Convert to Miro Format (Best for Visual Organization)**

If you want a structured visual format:

1. **Create Miro account** (free tier available)
2. **Import PDF to Miro:**
   - Upload `FIGMA_UI_SPECIFICATION.pdf` to Miro
   - Miro will organize it visually
   - You can add frames, sticky notes, etc.

3. **Export from Miro to Figma:**
   - Miro can export to Figma format
   - Better structure for design work

**Pros:**
- Visual organization
- Better for collaboration
- Can add annotations and notes

**Cons:**
- Requires Miro account
- Extra step in workflow
